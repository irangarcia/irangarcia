Hey! 

I'm a seasoned Frontend Engineer and Technical Lead with +3 years of experience in the software industry. Currently, I thrive as a key contributor at Croct, a fast-paced startup dedicated to real-time personalization solutions. 

My passion lies in developing pixel-perfect user interfaces that not only meet the highest quality standards but also prioritize performance and accessibility.

My journey as a Frontend Software Engineer has equipped me with a understanding of SaaS products and the importance of maintaining software quality. I am a firm believer in achieving excellence through rigorous code reviews and the implementation of automated tests, be it unit tests or end-to-end tests.
